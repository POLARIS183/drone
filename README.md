# PolarisDrone

- Acrobatics can be found in acrobatic.py
- If you need to emergency-stop, use emergency.py.
- ✨Easy!

## Usage

- On Windows, use the file win-install.bat to install the needed files.
- You can also use pip install djitellopy to install.
- Run the python files using python ***.py

## How this works

This uses the djitellopy repository available at https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy:

- It uses the tello.***() function to operate the programs.
- You can edit them free of charge - email any of your best submissions to me at northpolaris@protonmail.com - they might be featured below!

## What do these projects do?
- Acrobatics.py turns your Tello drone into an acrobat/scientist - watch it do backflips, turns, and measurements with ease!
- If any drone project fails, run emergency.py to auto-stop the drone.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy the programs!
