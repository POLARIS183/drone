# Hi, I'm POLARIS183, and this is my attempt to get a Tello drone to do some cool tricks!
# I'm writing this code on behalf of my friend, who runs the drone.
# First things first - I'm going to import the Tello function from PyPi:djitellopy, along with time.
# You can see this on Github - https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy.
